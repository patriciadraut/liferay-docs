# Managing Liferay DXP with Liferay Connected Services

[TOC levels=1-4]

Liferay Connected Services (LCS) is a set of tools and services for managing your @product@ instances. LCS can help you activate your instances and manage your
subscriptions. In other words, LCS is like a butler for the mansion that is
@product@. Even better, the features of LCS work regardless of whether your
instance is on a single discreet server or distributed across a cluster. It's
like having a single butler that can serve several mansions at once! 

Before going any further, you should take note of a few key terms used 
throughout this guide: 

**Project:** Represents a group of users belonging to a company or 
organization. For example, a project can consist of all the users from a 
project team or business unit, or it can include the entire company. 

**Environment**: Represents a physical cluster of servers or a virtual or
logical aggregation of servers. 

**Server**: Describes a concrete @product@ instance. It can be a standalone 
server or a cluster node.
